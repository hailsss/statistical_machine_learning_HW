    "The authors of the paper, James D. Fearon and David D. Laitin study and evaluate the possible root causes of the many civil wars that took place in the United States after the Cold War between the mid to late 1900s. They perform various analyses using factors which might be possible influences on civil strife such as Per Capita Income, Ethnic and Religious Composition, Democracy and Civil Liberties, among many others.\n",
    "They also disprove a few commonly believed theories such as the civil wars taking place due to changes in the international system, more ethnic and religious diversity causing such civil conflicts and the ability to predict the occurence of a civil war based on the strength of political and ethnic grievances of the people of a nation. They lay out many such hypotheses based on common arguments and rebut them using solid evidence they gathered from their data. Moreover, they ellaborate on what common misconception might have led to such false notions regarding the matter.\n",
    "They conclude several interesting things at the end of the study such as the conditions favoring civil wars not being ethnic and religious diversity against popular belief. In fact, conditions that favour insurgency were found to be state weakness [\"Decolonization from the 1940s through the 1970s gave birth to a large number of financially, bureaucratically, and militarily weak states\"] indicated by the population, poverty and instability within a state. \n"
